# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` module. This project demonstrates basic game development principles, including user input handling, game logic, and graphics.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control the snake using arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
- **Collision Detection:** Detect collisions with the game boundaries and the snake's own body.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the player's score and display it on the screen.
- **Responsive Controls:** Smooth and responsive control of the snake’s movement.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that sets up the game window, handles user inputs, and controls the game loop.
- `snake.py`: Contains the `Snake` class, which manages the snake’s movement and growth.
- `food.py`: Contains the `Food` class, which handles the creation and positioning of food items.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class, which displays the score and game-over messages.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right

3. Eat the red food to increase your score and make the snake grow.
4. Avoid collisions with the screen edges and the snake's own body.
